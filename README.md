# CNN_Architectures
This repository contains all the famous CNN networks and compares them on tiny imagenet dataset. 

### About Dataset
How many classes are there in ImageNet?
200 classes
It was created for students to practise their skills in creating models for image classification. The Tiny ImageNet dataset has 100,000 images across 200 classes. Each class has 500 training images, 50 validation images, and 50 test images.
