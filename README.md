# CNN_Architectures
This repository contains all the famous CNN networks and compares them on tiny imagenet dataset. 

### About Dataset
How many classes are there in ImageNet?
200 classes
It was created for students to practise their skills in creating models for image classification. The Tiny ImageNet dataset has 100,000 images across 200 classes. Each class has 500 training images, 50 validation images, and 50 test images.

## Arch 1 :- LeNet 
### About 
LeNet-5, from the paper <b>Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition</b>, is a very efficient convolutional neural network for handwritten character recognition. <br>
Paper: Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition <br>
Authors: <b>Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner</b> <br>
Published in: Proceedings of the IEEE (1998) <br> 

### Imp Points 
1) First ever implementation of backpropogation in Convolution Neural Network. 
2) Use of 5x5 Kernels with stride=1 in Convolution layer and 2x2 kernel with stride=2 in Average Pooling layer. <br> 
   Activation function used originally - Sigmoid 
3) A kernel used in convolution layer would extract features out of input images via the concept called edge detection. Earlier these kernels were hard coded but use of Neural Network allowed these kernels to be made of trainable weights that could adjust themselves by the concept of backpropogation. 
4) No.of kernel used in LeNet were 6 in 1st layer and 16 in 2nd layer. More the number of kernels (or filters) more amount of features extracted in a layer.
