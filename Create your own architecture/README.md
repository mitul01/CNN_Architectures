# How to create your own architecture?
--> Steps to follow: <br>
-Develop an idea of architecture to implement. <br> 
-Import the cnn blocks from cnn_blocks.py file required for your architecture. <br>
Example:- <br>
```python
from cnn_blocks import inception_residual_block_A,inception_residual_block_B,inception_residual_block_C
from cnn_blocks import inception_block_reduction_A,inception_block_reduction_B
from cnn_blocks import residual_block_v2
```
